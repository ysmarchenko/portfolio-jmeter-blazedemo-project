# JMeter Load Test for BlazeDemo üöÄ

This repository contains a JMeter test plan designed to simulate load and performance testing for the BlazeDemo website. The test plan performs various HTTP requests and assertions to evaluate the response time ‚è±Ô∏è and correctness ‚úÖ of the application.

## Test Plan Overview üìù

The test plan consists of the following main parts:

1. **Thread Group**: Simulates 10/100/1000 users performing the same operations with a ramp-up time of 1 second.
2. **HTTP Requests**: Several POST requests that simulate searching for tickets ‚úàÔ∏è, selecting a flight, and confirming a booking.
3. **Assertions**: Response code and content assertions to verify the correctness of the server's response.
4. **Results Collection**: Collects detailed test results, including response times, latency, and success status.

## Requirements üõ†Ô∏è

- [Apache JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/) 5.6.3 or later
- Java 8 or later ‚òïÔ∏è

## How to Run üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1. Download and install [Apache JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine üíª.
3. Open JMeter `bin` folder in the terminal
4. To run the test from the command line, use the following command:

   ```bash
   ./jmeter -n -t ${PATH_TO_TEST_PLAN}/LoadTestBlazeDemo.jmx -JUSERS_COUNT=${THREADS_NUMBER} -l <path_to_results_folder>/Results-${THREADS_NUMBER}-users.jtl -e -o ${PATH_TO_RESULTS_FOLDER}/Test-Report-${THREADS_NUMBER}

## Test Plan Structure üìÇ

The test plan includes the following:

- **Thread Group**: Configures the number of threads (users) and ramp-up time ‚è≥.
- **HTTP Request Samplers**: Sends HTTP requests to the BlazeDemo website (searching, selecting flights, and booking tickets) ‚úàÔ∏è.
- **Assertions**: Ensures that the response codes and content are correct.
- **Result Collectors**: Saves test results for further analysis.

## Example Report üìä

A sample report can be found in the `test-results` folder. Additionally, here's a screenshot showing the response time from the report:
